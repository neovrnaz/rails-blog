# Ruby on Rails Blog

This sample Ruby on Rails blog application shows a good understanding of the MVC pattern.
* Users can perform CRUD operations on pages and posts.
* New pages and posts can be added using a clean and easy to use interface
* Once the page or post has been created, users have the option to update or delete them.
* The controllers pass the data from the model and render it to the view.

## Usage
First, clone or download the files. Once in the directory, you can type in this command prompt to start using the address book.  

```shell script
rails server
```
Navigate to: 127.0.0.1:3000 and append /posts to it.
